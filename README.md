## Project Overview

### What the Project Aims to Achieve

This interactive story transports players into the world of **Xayah** and **Rakan**, two legendary characters from the League of Legends universe. Players step into the role of Xayah, embarking on a critical mission to rescue her soulmate, Rakan, from human captors.
The narrative is designed as a **Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)** experience, where each decision fundamentally alters the story's trajectory. Unlike traditional linear narratives, this game empowers players to shape the protagonist's journey through strategic choices, leading to multiple potential outcomes and endings.

### Project Goals

### FAQs
1. **Q:** Do I need to be familiar with League of Legends to enjoy this interactive story?

    **A:** Not at all! While the story is set in the League of Legends universe and features familiar characters like **Xayah** and **Rakan**, it's designed to be enjoyable even for those who haven't played the game. The narrative stands on its own, focusing on a compelling story of love, loss, and resilience.

2. **Q:** What's your process when you hit a roadblock during development?

    **A:** For this interactive narrative the main challenge I faced in this project was the code stonewalling the storytelling. I realized I was working harder not smarter.

    I took a breather put on my creative writing hat and switched gears. I grabbed my trusty notebook and outlined the entire story, mapping out different choices and their outcomes. This gave me a much clearer vision. Next, in order to prevent doing the same work twice, I moved the draft to Word revising the story before ultimately merging it back into the code. Much smoother!

    My **"typical"** method for solving problems is: 

* **Take a Moment to Stop and Inhale:** I physically shut my eyes, inhale deeply a few times, and empty my mind. This is incredibly beneficial! 

* **Assess the Situation:** I use my project notebook to jot down what's **working**, what's **not**, and where I'm **headed**. It's like taking inventory of my progress. 

* **Analyze and separate:** I break down the issues into **smaller** more manageable parts. Breaking it down into smaller chunks can feel less overwhelming.  

  **Refer to Resources:** If I'm really stuck, I'll look for inspiration in other interactive narratives, games, or even books. Seeing how others approach similar challenges can spark new ideas.

3. **Q:** How long did it take to develop?

    **A:** This project is ongoing! The initial development phase took 2 weeks that I started in February, 2024 but I see it as an evolving passion project.
